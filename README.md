This project serves to illustrate the interactive nature of human-computer interfaces, specifically the need to consider task hierarchy, procedural knowledge, interaction and information design, and the constraints of human information processing, all of which interact to contribute to the usability of a human-computer interface.

In this project, I designed and built the interaction for a pushbutton-input and auditory-output interface for listening to an audio book. You can think of the user interface as the software that would be used for a device such as that shown in Figure 1, in which there is is an auditory display but no visual display, and in which there are five buttons for input, though the system, users will use the five "home" keys on the keyboard (space, J, K, L, and ;).

A user interface is created in which a person uses five keys on a computer's physical keyboard to navigate through auditory menus that permit the user to navigate through the book.
